On July 6, Pokemon GO was released into the world; an app that allowed the user to catch pokemon in the real world with their phone camera. This app helped bring AR into the spotlight, and highlight its capabilities.

                                <p>One of the most exciting applications of augmented reality is with navigation and global positioning systems. Developed by the company ABB, the navigation app plots the route of the car in real time on top of the physical road. This allows the driver to visualize perfectly the turn they need to make.
                                </p>
                                <p>Currently ABB utilizes this app as more of a gimmick than an actual product; a powerful tool to attract the attention of investors and customers. This shows the larger role that augmented reality is playing in marketing. Much like the Soda Shaq game, ABB employs an eye-catching tactic to set their product apart.

                                <p>One way that the military employs augmented reality is with a heads-up display. The display includes a transparent screen set in front of the fighter pilot’s eye in such a way that they can see the information on the screen while simultaneously viewing the physical world around them. Data typically displayed to the pilot includes altitude, airspeed and the horizon line in addition to other critical data. The term "heads-up" comes from the fact that the pilot doesn't have to look down at the aircraft's instrumentation to get the data they need.
                                </p>
                                <p><span class="not">The Head-Mounted Display (HMD) is used by ground troops. Critical data such as enemy location can be presented to the soldier within their line of sight. This technology is also used for simulations for training purposes.</span></p>

                                <p>The use of augmented reality when training doctors and surgeons has been revolutionary for the medical field. One of the most common uses of augmented reality in the field has been through virtual surgery, which the student can practice without any risk of damaging people or equipment. In addition, visualizations aid in explaining complex medical conditions to patients. Augmented reality can reduce the risk of an operation by giving the surgeon improved sensory perception. This technology can be combined with MRI or X-ray systems and bring everything into a single view for the surgeon.
                                </p>
                                <p>Augmented reality can also be used practically in the operating room to allow the neurosurgeon to overlay a 3d scan of the patient's brain onto the actual patient, allowing for much more precision.
                                </p>

                                <p>With the current age of entertainment and overstimulation, keeping the attention of young students in the classroom can often prove to be a momentous task. To aid in this task, many teachers are turning to augmented reality as a means to engage students. The enthrallment and wonder that comes from new technology such as augmented reality often helps to keep the attention of students and open their minds to new experiences. It’s another tool in an educator's toolbelt to aid in the pursuit of knowledge.
                                </p>

                                <p>Augmented reality is not only meant to show information in a classroom, it is often a canvas that students can use to make projects of their very own. Apps such as ColAR Mix allow students to design their own objects in a 3d space. In high schools or postsecondary education, augmented reality can also inspire app development and inspire students to delve into a whole new technological medium. It is this exposure to technology that needs to happen in order for AR to be developed further in the coming years.

                                <p>As of 2017, the current state of augmented reality is very realistic. Although augmented reality has often been overshadowed by virtual reality, it is quickly becoming a household name. Over the past few years, augmented reality has developed rapidly. Project Tango by Google was one of the first products that reflects the use of augmented reality today. In 2015, Microsoft’s HoloLens gave us an early example of what a high-powered augmented reality device would look like. Finally, Pokemon GO, released in 2016, helped cement augmented reality in mainstream culture.

                                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                                <p>The first time somebody experiences augmented reality, it can often seem like magic. However, AR works by utilizing a camera, display, sensors, and many lines of code. Many AR devices use multiple sensors, which allows the device to sense the depth of a space, and track real world objects so that the computer knows exactly where in space it is. Next, the computer uses the points it has tracked to determine where to place an object, and to keep it in the same place, even when the camera is moved around. The more advanced the device, the more accurately it can detect the environment and display objects accurately.
                                </p>

                                            <p>Currently one of the biggest drawbacks to modern day augmented reality technology is that tracking (especially on phones and tablets) can often be buggy and untrustworthy. However, new sensors are being developed that provide better information about a device's surroundings with a smaller overall size.

This means that the closer we can get to blurring the line between the two, the more seamless augmented reality will be.

                                <p>As with any wireless technology, augmented reality devices certainly have the potential to be hacked maliciously. As augmented reality becomes more and more common in the world, the repercussions of a hack could become greater and greater. For example, a hacker could compromise the output of an AR system, tricking users into thinking computer-generated objects are real – such as a false speed limit sign. This type of problem would only lead to chaos and public distrust of AR devices. To combat this, AR developers would need to develop a device that can convince the public of its safety.
                                </p>

                                <p>In addition to compromising the cybersecurity of a device, a potential breach could mean that a hacker could gain information that the user would like to be kept private. Many augmented reality devices are centered on personal aspects of the user - such as how military devices monitor everything about a pilot, from his heart rate, to eye movement. As augmented reality devices continue to gain popularity, it is important that the data of the user be kept safe.
