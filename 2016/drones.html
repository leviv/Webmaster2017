                                <p>Drones can maneuver where few other vehicles could because of their size. <span class="not">Helicopters offer a large view of a situation while a police officer has a first-person point of view. </span>Drones are the perfect blend as they can do both while also being able to navigate easier than either a helicopter or a police officer. They can perform dangerous tasks without endangering the pilot. <span class="not">This will change the way that police operate during rescue missions. </span></p>
                                <p>While not just serving people in dangerous situations, drones can serve people in unfortunate conditions. Titan Aerospace is an aerospace company that was just bought out by Google in 2014. The company manufactures Solar Powered Atmospheric Satellite Drones that have many functions such as natural disaster and weather monitoring as well as space and earth photography. <span class="not">Their solar drive allows them to be in continuous flight at 20 kilometer high for up to five years. They will be more accurate and be able to take better photographs than previous technologies.</span> Google plans to advance this company and develop drones capable of providing internet access to remote areas of the world.

Not only has the STEM revolution affected education inside the classroom, but outside of it as well. Many clubs and organizations are applying for grants to get drones because of their many educational uses. <span class="not">Drones expand the mind of the students, allowing them to think bigger and more creatively. Students begin to think of ways to utilize the drones in ways they cannot with a camera. The drone itself is an educational tool.</span> From aspiring photographers, to hopeful engineers, to eager programmers, all of them can use the drone and learn from it.</p>

                                <p>In research and scientific works, an overall view is imperative to data collection. An overhead perspective, especially in agriculture, is incredibly useful. Farmers have been using planes for years to fertilize and water crops, but also to see the overall view of the land. They are able to see which areas are better off than others and from there, they can take action. With drones, it is much cheaper, faster, and advantageous to survey the land. Drones can capture incredibly accurate images of the fields in a single flight that can later be put together into a single image. <span class="not">Agricultural drones are also capable of mounting different cameras for different imaging allowing farmers to conduct elevation modeling of the crops, moisture analysis of the soil and erosion analysis of the land.</span></p>

                                <h2>Population Growth</h2>
                                <p>As well as examining plants, drones are also capable of evaluating population growth. A group of scientists near Nantucket have begun to use drones to photograph seal populations to better determine their numbers and growth rate. <span class="not">The scientists fly the drones to a remote island that is a breeding ground for seals and where they gather in huge numbers. </span>The population of the gray seals have caused some concern for beachgoers and fishermen alike in the area, necessitating the need for population evaluation. The study will be ongoing and collaborate with similar studies to better understand how the seal population is affecting the environment.</p>

                                <h2>Current Technology</h2>
                                <p>Most commercial drones in today’s market are quad-copters, but there are many other types including hex-copters, octo-copters, and fixed wing drones. <span class="not">Most drones are also lightweight and symmetrical, making them easier to fly and more maneuverable when in the air.</span>
                                   <br><br>
                                    Drones have three main categories they fit into when talking about how they are controlled. Remote Controlled, semi-autonomous, and autonomous. Remote Controlled (RC) UAVs are commonly seen in the lower end of the drone market and allow the pilot full control over the drone. <span class="not">The pilot has much more control, but has to be attentive at all times. </span>Semi-autonomous drones allow the pilot control over most of the drone, but the drone has built-in sensors that allow it to hover at its current altitude<span class="not">, allowing the pilot a break from fear of crashing the drone</span>. Autonomous drones give little to no control to the pilot and are usually found in the very high end of the drone market.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <span class="not">However, it is not the drone itself that is the impressive piece of technology. A great drone is nothing without its attachments. From different cameras to measuring equipment to shipping rigs, the different attachments and their uses coupled with a drone are what make UAVs such groundbreaking technology. </span>
                                </p>

                                <h2>Automated Technology</h2>
                                <p>Another viral video about drones that was released in May 2015 was the Lily drone: an automated drone that follows the pilot around by itself.<span class="not"> The reason this video went viral was because the Lily drone is activated by the pilot just throwing the drone in the air. But, it was a promotional video and the drone is not fully functioning like it was promoted.</span> However, DJI, a large dominating drone company, released a similar video that showcased their drone being a little more capable than the Lily drone. The Phantom X drone by DJI is able to dodge obstacles and still follow the pilot. It's still just a concept though. Nonetheless, this shows how far drones have come even in the last few years and the future possibilities of drone technology are riveting.</p>

                                            <p>A setback of current drones is the battery capacity. Most commercial drones have a small battery allowing them only about 30 minutes of airtime.

They usually require disassembly and storage in a large protective backpack. This makes them a heavy burden and not incredibly mobile. When stronger and lighter materials are incorporated into drones as well as design innovations, we will see a new generation of drones that are smaller, more mobile and ready to take anywhere.

                                <p>Since drones were initially developed as weapons by the military, a stigma has followed around the word “drone”.<span class="not"> Especially since they are still being used by the US military in active combat, fear has been voiced by not just doomsday preppers, but everyday people and their concerns are valid.</span> There are still consideration that needs to be addressed about the future of drones.
                                   <br><br>
                                    The Federal Aviation Administration has received alarmingly increasing reports of drones near airplanes and airports. <span class="not">It has increased from just a few per month from last year to near 100 a month. They also report that the number of drone sightings has increased from 238 in 2014 to 721 in 2015, more than tripling in just a year. </span>Although there have been no accidents, officials are concerned the even a lightweight drone can cause serious damage to an airplane if sucked into the engine or if it hits one of the airline’s windows.

                                <p>Since many drones come equipped with cameras, privacy has become a huge concern and a point of debate since UVAs recent popularity. In Seattle, a woman was changing in her room on the 26th floor of her apartment building when she saw a drone with a camera flying outside of her window. Another commonly quoted story is one where a man in Kentucky was arrested after shooting down a drone that was flying over his property. <span class="not">When UAVs are seen or even caught, it is extremely hard to trace back to the owner as there is no form of identification or location tracker within the drone. So, how can law enforcers punish law breakers that they cannot track? </span>Many people are afraid of how easily drones can invade the privacy of others and not face charges.</p>
