                    <p>TSA is a non-profit organization within schools that allows students to learn, make, and compete in topics they are interested in. TSA chapters take the study of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) beyond the classroom and give students the chance to pursue academic challenges among friends with similar goals and interests. Together, chapter members work on competitive events, attend conferences on the state and national levels, and have a good time raising funds to get there. Chapter organization develops leadership, as members may become officers within state, and even national TSA. Our chapter is committed to help our members explore and succeed in their passions.
                        <br><br>
                        Waxahachie Global High School was founded in 2008 as one of the first STEM academies in the region. Global High is an early college high school, and has a project-based approach to learning in most its classes. Since its conception, TSA has fit in perfectly with the ideals of Global High. So, in the same year that Global was opened, Chapter 501 was born. Founded and led by April Moon, the chapter was instantly a huge success. The chapter hosted many community outreach programs, and promoted STEM within the school. The students participating in TSA also achieved success, sending multiple students to state and national competitions. Three years later, Scott Warren became the head advisor for TSA, and was succeeded by Michael Warren for the 2015-2016 school year. This year, TSA is the most successful club in the school, with the highest membership in Chapter 501's history. Hopefully the club will continue to advance at the same rate it is now, and we will see even more success in the future.</p>
